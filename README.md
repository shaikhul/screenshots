# screenshots
All about my screenshot sharing, specially in PR comments :)

To create a screenshot link just go to the screenshot from this repo.
In the url change the `blob` part to `raw` and that's it, you got a valid link to share :)

### Example 
* https://github.com/shaikhul/screenshots/blob/master/posix_setegid_coverage.png will show the image inside github repo browser
* https://github.com/shaikhul/screenshots/raw/master/posix_setegid_coverage.png will show the image as preview
